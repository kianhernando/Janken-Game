# ジャンケン - A One-Handed Journey

## Overview

Fight fierce opponents through the arts of ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS! 

Handell, a single hand, wakes up... only to find handself detached from its arm. Awoken by its loss, Handell travels around, searching for its long-lost body.

Janken: A One-Handed Journey is a 2D turn-based RPG, similar to the likes of the Mother series, Dragon Quest series, and Undertale.

Explore a unique combat system, based on the known kids' game, “Rock-Paper-Scissors”, by using it on a “handful” of enemies, on a quest to find Handell’s true belonging! 

However, be cautious: you only have one chance...
